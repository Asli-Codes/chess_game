#Chess With Python ♟️

A simple object-oriented chess engine implemented in Python.  
This project focuses on the **backend logic** of chess — representing the board, defining chess pieces, and implementing movement rules.  
It does **not** include a graphical interface.

## Features 🤍
- **Object-Oriented Design** — Each chess piece is represented as a separate class.
- **Board Management** — Class-based board representation with 8x8 grid.
- **Movement Logic** — Each piece implements its own valid move generation.
- **Enemy Detection** — Determine if a piece belongs to the opponent.

- Pawn 
- Rook
